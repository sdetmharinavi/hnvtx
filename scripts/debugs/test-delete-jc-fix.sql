# Test the delete JC fix

echo "=== Testing Delete JC Fix ==="
echo ""

echo "Fixed delete JC functionality by:"
echo "1. Added 'id' field to JunctionClosure type in hooks file"
echo "2. The types file already had the correct definition"
echo "3. Page now correctly imports JunctionClosure with id field"
echo ""

echo "=== SQL COMMANDS TO TEST ==="
echo ""

echo "-- Test 1: Check if junction_closures table has data"
echo "SELECT id, name, node_id, ofc_cable_id, position_km"
echo "FROM junction_closures"
echo "LIMIT 5;"
echo ""

echo "-- Test 2: Test delete operation directly"
echo "SELECT id FROM junction_closures LIMIT 1;"
echo "-- Copy an ID from above and run:"
echo "-- DELETE FROM junction_closures WHERE id = 'your-jc-id-here';"
echo ""

echo "-- Test 3: Check if triggers are working"
echo "SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, action_timing"
echo "FROM information_schema.triggers"
echo "WHERE event_object_table = 'junction_closures'"
echo "ORDER BY trigger_name;"
echo ""

echo "=== WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN ==="
echo ""
echo "✅ Delete JC shows success toast AND actually deletes the JC"
echo "✅ No more 'Cannot delete junction closure: id is null' errors"
echo "✅ Route details refresh after deletion"
echo "✅ Cable segments are automatically recreated after JC deletion"
echo ""

echo "=== NEXT STEPS ==="
echo ""
echo "1. Test the delete functionality in your app"
echo "2. Check browser console for any remaining errors"
echo "3. Verify that cable segments are properly recreated"
echo ""

echo "=== DEBUGGING ==="
echo ""
echo "If delete still doesn't work:"
echo "1. Check browser console for TypeScript errors"
echo "2. Verify the JunctionClosure type is imported correctly"
echo "3. Check if the delete mutation is being called with correct ID"
echo "4. Look at Supabase logs for database errors"
