echo "=== Browser Console Debug ==="
echo "Since database functions work manually but not through app..."

echo "üîç Check Browser Console:"
echo "1. Open your app in browser"
echo "2. Press F12 to open DevTools"
echo "3. Go to Console tab"
echo "4. Add a JC through Route Manager"
echo "5. Look for these specific logs:"

echo "‚úÖ Should see:"
echo "   === JC FORM SUBMIT DEBUG ==="
echo "   === CREATE CABLE SEGMENTS DEBUG ==="
echo "   Calling create_cable_segments_on_jc_add with: {...}"
echo "   Function result: {...}"

echo "‚ùå If missing any of these:"
echo "   - The function is not being called"
echo "   - There's a JavaScript error preventing the call"
echo "   - The component is not loading properly"
echo ""

echo "üîß Next Steps:"
echo "1. Clear browser cache and reload"
echo "2. Check if there are any JavaScript errors"
echo "3. Verify the Route Manager component is using the updated JcFormModal"
echo "4. Check if the useCableSegmentation hook is properly imported"

echo "üìã What to look for:"
echo "- Red error messages in console"
echo "- Missing debug logs"
echo "- Network errors when calling database functions"
echo "- Component loading errors"

echo "üéØ If no debug logs appear:"
echo "   - The JcFormModal component might not be the one being used"
echo "   - There might be a different code path for adding JCs"
echo "   - The component might not be loading the useCableSegmentation hook"
