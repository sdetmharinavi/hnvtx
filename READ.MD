There seems some logical error in system connection section.Suppose We added/edited a service at system say Harinavi B2 with working port as 5.7.In connectivity tab we added for end node detail as Gobindapur B2 with port/interface 3.6. Then it will add that service to Harinavi B2 at port 5.7 and at Gobindapur B2 at port 3.6. Now when I edit at Gobindapur B2, for start node also its showing 5.7 which is wrong. If I want to change start node to 3.6 and other correct details, at Harinavi B2 also working port changes wrongly to 3.6 instead of current correct value 5.7 and data from Gobindapur B2 get deleted from 3.6.
