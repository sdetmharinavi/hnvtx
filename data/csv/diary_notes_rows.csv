Checked the optical fibers and found them OK. There was an optical power loss in the media. The power loss was due to a fault in the HUAWEI port — the Tx power at the port itself was -17 dBm. Changing the SFP did not resolve the issue.

Configuration was done in Tejas and the details were posted in the CPAN group for shifting to another CPAN port. After the CPAN configuration was completed by the CPAN team, MAC was received from both ends, and the media appeared to be OK. However, ping was still not successful from their router.
The media converter and power adaptor at SBI Baruipur Bazar Branch were also replaced with a new one.
The vendor was approached to check the issue at their local end.",,2025-10-21 00:00:00+00,2025-10-21 00:00:00+00
